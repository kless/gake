Gake
====
Gake is a utility that automatically builds executable programs from Go source code by reading files whose name ends '_task.go' that contains the TaskXxx functions, which are run and work just like in package "testing"

By default, the binary built is temporary unless it is used -c or -keep flag;
both flags check if the binary has to be re-compiled due to source code updated.

"-keep" flag stores the compiled binaries into a global directory under 'HOME/.task'

**Note:** the task files need the build constraint: "+build gake"  
For an example, see in directory 'testdata'.
